#### Sign on one of the levels / Cop Rules ####

>

#### Cop's description ####

> Follows the Law of the Land unflinchingly, even if it doesn't always make perfect sense.  Despite this, the Cop became disenchanted with the current government after __a law was passed preventing more than four people from dancing side by side__, sadly forcing the Cop's Village People cover group to disband.

#### Scientist's description ####

> Has devoted their life to advancing science and torturing gorillas.  As a result of the former, the Scientist has acquired a number of fun toys to take on their adventure.  While they would probably prefer to be testing these toys on caged gorillas in the name of scientific progress (read: undiagnosed sadism), the Scientist has joined the Resistance due to __the Mayor cutting beaker allowances to 1 per laboratory__.

#### Wrestler's description ####

> Manhandling, smashing, beating -- all in a day's work for the simple-minded but strong-of-heart Wrestler!  But in truth, this behavior stems from the Wrestler's severe frustrations with the world.  __Why has the mayor banned playful roughhousing__?  Why do so many businesses frown upon shirtlessness?  Why do books have all those stupid words in them?  AAARRRGH!!!

#### Unlocked Doors disaster (unimplemented/removed) description ####

> __The Mayor instituted a "Friendly Neighbor" policy where people must legally keep their doors unlocked.  But he didn't say anything about Door Detonators__.

#### Firefighter's description ####

> Fire hoses are pretty effective, but they're so big and unwieldy! So, what's a more efficient solution? __According to the Mayor: chop off the arms of Firefighters and install state-of-the-art Water Cannons on the nub__. While this has led to a moderate improvement in fire control effectiveness, it has caused Firefighter morale to plummet, what with all the unwanted mutilation and such.

#### Excerpt from a Home Base intro ####

> FOURTH: As you may know, __the Mayor has banned Chicken Nuggets, due to the fact that they once caused him a mild tummy ache__.<br/>
> Chicken Nuggets have since become a rare and precious commodity.<br/>
> If you can scrounge up some Chicken Nuggets, we can trade 'em for things that can help you out.<br/>
> The Doctor, Thief and Soldier can brief you a bit more on the Nugget situation.

#### Excerpt from the game intro ####

> Once home to peace and prosperity, the city has fallen into the hands of __a ruthless and dictatorial Mayor__.<br/>
> Elected on __vague promises of "lower taxes" and "more beer"__, his true colors began to show immediately upon his inauguration.<br/>
> __The Mayor's first executive orders were a massive raise on taxes, and a one-time confiscation of all alcoholic beverages__.<br/>
> He stated that the confiscation was so he could throw "the mother of all ragers" for his constituents.<br/>
> But in reality, there was only like one keg and a bag of tortilla chips.<br/>
> It was suuuper lame.<br/>
> He used the money and extra booze to fund a private army of goons, happy to carry out his every nefarious bidding.

#### Excerpt from signs in the Mayor's Office ####

> Anyone can run for Mayor!  Here's what determines your electability:<br/>
> Making people like you, getting rid of people who don't, people being the same class as you, and engaging in fruitful financial transactions.<br/>
> You'll need a majority of floors to vote in your favor.  The existing mayor starts with an advantage!<br/>
> All non-imprisoned living/undead residents of the city have a vote!

#### Comedian interaction dialogue ####

> I can't believe the Mayor banned jokes about walrus hygiene... That was my whole schtick!

#### Streets of Rogue Soundtrack's description on Steam ####

> Welcome to the Streets of Rogue. __The Mayor has banned all unofficially-sanctioned music and demanded the forfeiture of every non-compliant cassette tape and compact disc__. All that has been saved is a collection of vintage dance music B-sides called "NOW That's What I Hope You Think Is Music," passed around furtively in the shadows by the Resistance. Treat your copy well, for it is all you have left.

## Opinions ##

#### Record of Evidence ####

> I might raise taxes on bacon cheeseburgers.<br/>
> I may have spent some of my campaign money on socks.


#### Excerpt from a dialogue in the Tutorial ####

> - Look, you have no right to allow some random guy off the street to take shots at me for the sake of some.. what did you call it, "Tutorial"?<br/>
> - We can do whatever we want to you, we're the ones in charge!<br/>
> - You know, this is the same sort of ridiculous authoritarian crap that the Mayor pulls...<br/>
> - Stop being a wimp, you'll be fine!
